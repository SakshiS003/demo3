<h1>Cryptography</h1>
<p>Cryptography is the practice and study of techniques for secure communication in the presence of adversaries. It involves transforming information into an unreadable format (encryption) to protect it from unauthorized access and then converting it back to a readable format (decryption) for authorized recipients. This process ensures confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of data</p>
